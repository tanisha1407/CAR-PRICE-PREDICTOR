# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using XGBoost and Streamlit

This project predicts the resale price of a car using an XGBoost regression model based on features such as year, fuel type, transmission, seller type, kilometers driven, etc. The model is trained in a Jupyter Notebook and the UI is built using Streamlit, making it easy to interact with and use.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.9+
- Jupyter Notebook – for model training and analysis
- Spyder IDE – for building `.py` scripts
- XGBoost – gradient boosting regression model
- Pandas, NumPy – for data handling
- Matplotlib, Seaborn – for visualizations
- Scikit-learn – for preprocessing and splitting
- Streamlit – to create the user interface
- JSON – for model saving/loading
